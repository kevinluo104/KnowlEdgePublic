# Usage of Tech from Units 1-5 in the Project

**Unit 1: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

We used JavaScript throughout the entire project, for both the frontend and backend. For styling, we used a combination of styled components and CSS files, together with jsx,
which is a combination of all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          
**Unit 2: React & Redux**

We used React to make our frontend, using the benefits of re-usuable components that React brings, keeping repeated code to a minimum. We also used redux and the store to maintain state in our application and access state throughout the entire project in different components.
          
**Unit 3: Node & Express**

A Node.js backend was used, in conjunction with Express to make our server and to communicate the front end with the backend. A RESTful API was made using the Express framework.
         
**Unit 4: MongoDB**

We used MongoDB to store the data in our application, such as announcements, images, course content (text), users, studysets, and more. In our server, we created Mongoose objects
for easy access and organization of MongoDB objects in our application. 
          
**Unit 5: Release Engineering**

We have deployed our application using Render, separating frontend and backend while doing so. Both the frontend and backend is now hosted on Render, and the endpoints now have
to be directed to server hosted on Render now.

# Contributions

**Loay Al Jahwari**

I was responsible for developing the student dashboard, which involved creating key components such as the navbar, and adding features like course enrollment. Additionally, I created a comprehensive comment section for the resource page, incorporating functionalities such as upvoting, downvoting, replying, and sorting. Moreover, I played an active role in implementing the design across different screens, ensuring a consistent and appealing user interface. Furthermore, I implemented in-app messaging functionality using Firebase.

**Kevin Luo**

Responsible for the development of major features, such as the class list (students in the class), student profile, and course resource pages. Integrated diverse input formats for the resource pages, each utilizing distinct backend storage methodologies tailored to their specific types, rendering based on the type of user logged in. Collaboratively implemented the Express middleware router with RESTful endpoints and MongoDB models to allow seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and database.

**Johnson Lu**

Contributed to the development of key features, including the integration of a notes page, course page (which includes an instructor and student view), and an announcement page. Additionally, incorporated logic that discriminates between logged-in instructors and students for course page and announcement page, thereby tailoring content access and modification privileges according to who is logged in. Lastly, collaboratively implemented the Express middleware router to facilitate communication between MongoDB and the frontend. 

**Kaiyuan Chen**

Implemented the initial study sets listing page that allows users to create study sets and add flashcards to them. This endeavor involved incorporating input functions and card displays, and rectifying various styling and routing challenges. Created the Flashcard Practice and Writing practice modes for users to practice the course content with instant feedback and results.

**Abigail Moraes**

Made significant contributions to the project, designing essential components like the Calendar, Student Dashboard, and Student Course Page through Figma. Implemented event management within the calendar and integrated Firebase authentication for seamless sign-up and login processes. Played a pivotal role in deploying the application and enforcing endpoint security using Firebase tokens.


# Special Use Cases (for instructors/graders)
Most of the use cases in our application are intuitive, however some of the them require special access (e.g. instructor login credentials), or are easy to miss. In addition to the basic functionalities of our app,
here are some highlighted use cases that require some extra information:

**Upload/Viewing of course documents (resources)**

To perform this use case, the user would need to login as an instructor, as only instructors have access to upload documents. To login as an instructor, run the app from the login screen and click on the "Login" button, and enter 
the credentials which will be provided through private message. Next, click on any course card, and then any module, which will bring down a drop-down menu of submodules. Click on a submodule, and that should bring you to the file upload page.
From the file upload page, instructors are given 3 options (PDF, image, text) to upload, and need to press the "Display Current Mode To Students" button to set the type of resource that will be displayed to the student. After uploading,
log out and log back in with a normal (student) account and head over to the course that you uploaded the resource to. The resource should be available on the screen to the student. 

**Chat Feature**

The chat feature is accessed by clicking on the "Messages" button on the navbar, or on the blue text message icon on the bottom right of the page. To create a message with someone, click on the magnifying glass, and type the name of the student you want to message. After sending a message to that student, you should log into the account of the student that received the message to view the receipt of the message. This can be done with one browser window in normal mode, and one in incognito mode.
You can also observe the live chat feature with the 2 user setup, as messages are displayed on the other user as soon as a message is sent over. Channels can be created by clicking on the 3 dots, which can be accessed by every other user in the course,
by searching for the channel name after pressing the magnifying glass icon.

**Calendar**

To create a new event, click on the "+" button of the left side of the screen and input the desired fields. For the course name, please enter in exactly how the course is named. (e.g. enter CPSC 455) Events created for the same day will appear
on the course card on the student dashboard, under "Today". Marking the event public displays the event for ALL users' calendar, as long as they are registered for the course. Setting the event private will result in the event being shown to
ONLY the instructors. Tasks can be created by clicking on the "+" button and clicking on the "Task" button on the pop-up. The difference between Task and Event are that Tasks are able to be checked off and completed. To check off or uncheck a task,
click on the checkmark on the right side of the calendar, which should give you options to check or uncheck each task. 

**Announcements**

To view/create announcements, click on a course which the student is enrolled into on the main student dashboard. Then, click on see more under the announcement section. Then click the Post Announcement button and fill in the fields and click submit. Afterwards the user should be able to see the new announcements. If the user is a student, they will be able to have the option to delete their own annoucements. If the user is an instructor, they will have the option to delete any announcements posted. To view all the announcements of the courses the user is enrolled in, navigate to the dashboard (first page the user sees upon login) and then click on the bell icon on the top right.

**User Profile**

To view/edit user profile, click on the pencil icon to the right of the student name on the main student dashboard. 

**Enroll/De-register in Courses**

To enroll in other courses, press the courses button in the nav bar, and press "Enroll". To de-register from courses, press the courses button in the nav bar, then press the X button next to the course that you want to delete.

**Course Page**

To edit the course page, the user must be on an instructor account. Then the instructor will be able to click on "add module" and type in the name of the module to create a new module. Then after creating a module, the user will have the option to either click the blue + icon to add a new submodule or click the red trash bin icon to delete the module. By clicking the + icon, the user will be able to input a name for the submodule and by submitting, a new submodule will appear under the module. For the submodule, the user will also see a red icon which they can click to remove the submodule.

**Notes Page**

To add a new page, the user can click the + icon next to the Notes heading on the top left. Then afterwards, the user can fill in the fields and by clicking enter individually in each field after typing, the note will be saved.
